I see that you as a moderator of this repo does not have an idea on what to do as all

thus i am going to suggest a mystery plot and see whether this will be able to help you

Perfect crime, locked room.
Locked room actually has a lot of windows, but it is impossible for anyone to pull out a key from the room as it as under the dead body
Formed by:
Place body on table (blood found on body belongs to next victim)
Use string to pull key under table
from another window pull table away 
land body on top of key

camouflage the table falling by collapsing other furniture
as the body was discovered immediately the culprit would only be able to throw the string nearby
discover string, suspect someone

next day kill the other someone with another locked room

have the body locked at home, ask victim who is co culprit to stand at windowsill, use rope to strangle from downstairs
evidence is momvement of rope identified on neck and railings

but because coculprit cut himself on the shoulder in the prev case, blood got on the rope, person with rope arrested
